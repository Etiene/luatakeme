# Lua Take Me
A list of Lua packages that are open source and need maintenance. Made with the purpose to facilitate the search for tools to make contributions and identify if there are crucial libraries that are abandoned and need adoption by a new maintainer.

Format:
```
* [Package Name](URL to source code or github repository): License type
```

##List of orphans
Orphan packages are those with `INACTIVE` maintainers (abandoned) to be forked / moved ownership / adopted by someone else.
* 

##List of siblings
Sibling packages (yes, I just made this up, feel free to suggest a better name / analogy), are those with `ACTIVE` maintainer(s), looking for more maintainers / contributors / sis & bros to join in and help make the package better.
* [Sailor](http://github.com/sailorproject): MIT

###To add packages to this list just make a pull request 
I will publish this list from time to time on [Lua.Space](http://lua.space)
